# Yakuza 0 Legend Style Fix
Allows you to change to legend style and normal style back and forth without going to pause menu for both Majima and Kiryu.

# Usage 
While in fight press R3/RS on controller or TAB on keyboard if you want to change TO legend style,
if you want to change FROM legend style use your regular key.

  ## Example
  [FROM -> TO (KEYBIND)]
  - Regular Style -> Legend Style (R3/RS or TAB)
  - Legend -> Brawler (DPAD UP / 1)
  - Legend -> Rush (DPAD LEFT / 2)
  - Legend -> Beast (DPAD RIGHT / 3)

# Installation
1. Go to your Y0's directory
2. Rename "libtgsa.dll" to "libtgsa_o.dll"
3. Paste file from [latest release](https://github.com/ibldzn/yakuza-0-legend-style-fix/releases/latest) to your Y0's directory
4. Your Y0's directory now should look something like this ![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RORyj0o.png)

# Known Bug
- Change style animation sometimes won't play correctly when changing to or from legend style
